# Planning our project
This week my team and I discussed about the features that our product would most likely have.
## Our product
Our product simply put, is a machine learning based game reviewing website. This product essentially takes the millions of reviews from steam. Filters out the so called "fake" reviews and summarizes the reviews into a page. We choose this as we wanted see if our idea is viable before moving to something more ambitious, such as detecting fake news.

## Product backlog
After much discussion, we came up with a few features to implement in the current sprint and in the following sprint.


The features are:
1. Login through steam auth
2. Search for games
3. Admin page
4. Comment system
5. Recommendation system (partial)

## What am I going to do for this first sprint?
My role is essentially to gather the thousands of reviews from steam, process them and hopefully build a model that can detect fake positive/fake negative reviews. My goal is to hit around the mark of 70-80% accuracy. 


## End
That's all for this week, see you next week!
