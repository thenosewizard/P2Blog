# Training update

Welcome back.

This week was not a productive week as the rest, due to other assignments such as UX.
However, I did manage to find 5 restaurents to showcase in our website. The 5 restaurents 
each had around 5000 reviews, more than what is needed.

# Thoughts on the results

As you can see more epochs is needed. The current reviews that I have shown you was only trained with 10 epochs, and it lasted around 25 mins. It seems that with more epochs the data generated gets better. Though getting human like reviews is a distant reality. Companies that use auto generated tweets and news has someone to edit them.

That's all for this week, see you in the next blog post!
